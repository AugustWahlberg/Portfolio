**My personal portfolio website** 

## Description
This is my portfolio site for my first year as a front-end developer. As of now the portfolio displays my first four websites, but will constantly be updated. The illustration on the site is own made. It represents me as a person - a calm and collected person who gets inspired by sensations.
