**My personal portfolio website** 

## Description
This is my portfolio site for my two year as a front-end developer, as well as some graphic design work. As of now the portfolio displays my first websites, but will constantly be updated. The illustration on the site is own made. It represents me as a person - a calm and collected person who gets inspired by sensations.
